### **Instruction, Scope, and Requirements for Grocery Store Simulation Project**

---

### **Project Scope**

This project simulates a grocery store where customers can:

1. Select items from a predefined list.
2. View the total cost of their shopping cart.
3. Choose a payment method (cash or card).
4. Generate a receipt saved as a text file.

The program reinforces basic Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, methods, arrays, loops, and file handling.

### **Requirements**

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **Predefined Item List**:
    - Create a list of grocery items with a name and price.
2. **Customer Shopping**:
    - Allow customers to select items by inputting an item number.
    - Store selected items in a shopping cart.
3. **Calculate Total Cost**:
    - Sum the prices of items in the cart and display the total.
4. **Checkout Process**:
    - Prompt the customer to choose a payment method (cash or card).
5. **Generate Receipt**:
    - Save the receipt as a text file with the customerâ€™s selected items, total cost, and payment method.

### **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Define Classes**

1. Create a class called `Item` with attributes:
    - `name` (String)
    - `price` (double)
2. Create a class called `GroceryStore` to manage:
    - The list of items available.
    - The shopping process (item selection, checkout, receipt generation).

---

### **Step 2: Predefined Item List**

- Create an `ArrayList` of `Item` objects in `GroceryStore`.
- Populate it with at least 5 items, each with a name and price.

---

### **Step 3: Handle Item Selection**

- Display the list of items with numbers for selection.
- Use a loop to allow customers to select multiple items until they choose to finish.
- Store selected items in a shopping cart (another `ArrayList`).

---

### **Step 4: Calculate Total**

- Write a method in `GroceryStore` to loop through the cart and calculate the total cost.
- Display the total after the customer finishes shopping.

---

### **Step 5: Checkout Process**

- Ask the customer to choose a payment method (cash or card) using simple prompts.
- Store the chosen payment method.

---

### **Step 6: Generate Receipt**

- Write a method to create a text file (e.g., `receipt_1.txt`).
- Include:
    - The list of items in the cart.
    - The total cost.
    - The payment method.

---

### **Expected Output**

- A functional console program where customers can:
    - View and select items.
    - See their total cost.
    - Choose a payment method.
    - Receive a receipt saved as a text file.
